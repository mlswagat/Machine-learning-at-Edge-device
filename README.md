Collection of research papers, blogs, tutorials on Machine learning at edge device

# Overview
Edge devices have limited storage and computing resources. Thus, training large amount of data on those devices are not feasible most of the times. To overcome this pre-trained machine learning models are used at the edge to do some operations. These models are trained in powerful on-premises or cloud server instances before deployment on the edge devices.
